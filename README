CImple is pretty much the simplest continuous integration system you
could ask for. It is a Sinatra application that responds to only a
couple of endpoints:

http://domain.com:4567/

Shows you the results of the last hook run. 

http://domain.com:4567/post-commit

Any endpoint other than / is the name of a hook. This same name should
be present at the top level of your commands.yml file.

== Configuration
Update commands.yml with the commands that you want to run at each
hook call. See that file for instructions.
